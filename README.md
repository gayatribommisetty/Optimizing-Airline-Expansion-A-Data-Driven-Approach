# Optimizing-Airline-Expansion-A-Data-Driven-Approach
## Project Overview
This project aims to assist an airline company in strategically expanding into the US Domestic airline market by identifying 5 profitable round-trip routes using comprehensive data analysis and insights. The company's motto, "On time, for you," emphasizes punctuality as a cornerstone of their brand identity.
## Datasets Used
1. **Flights Dataset**: Contains information about flight operations.
2. **Airport Codes Dataset**: Provides details about various airports.
3. **Tickets Dataset**: Includes ticket sales and passenger data.
## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Removing null values and filtering relevant data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new metrics such as fare per passenger.
3. **Outlier Removal**: Using IQR method to clean the dataset.
4. **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Grouping data by origin and destination to find averages.
5. **Airport Classification**: Filtering for medium and large airports.
6. **Financial Calculations**: Analyzing profitability and break-even points.
7. **Route Optimization**: Selecting the most profitable routes for investment.
